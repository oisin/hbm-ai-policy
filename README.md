The Human Brain Meat AI Policy

I concocted this policy when I set up [Chunky Labs](http://chunkylabs.com), my consultancy firm. The point was to let my clients-to-be know that when they were contracting me, that I would be doing the work myself rather than phoning it in via a mediocrity machine.

I think this is important. As a technology and organizational consultant, I need to grow my own brain and thoughts, and I can't do that if don't exercise learning and thinking. Using an LLM or "AI" in the marketing sense of the word is a total cop-out on that personal requirement.

Also, this policy gives your client a way to get in contact if there are any errors or mistakes made by me or anyone officially acting on my behalf. Everyone makes errors, and the important thing is that they can be analyzed and corrected. You can't email your LLM to talk about the mistakes it made.
